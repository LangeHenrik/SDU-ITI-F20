Make a simple game
▪ Each element is a simple square
▪ A blue square (the mouse) is controlled by the arrow keys on
the keyboard
▪ A red square (the cat) moves towards the mouse at all times
▪ Two or more orange squares (cheese) are spread on the
screen
▪ When the mouse touches a piece of cheese, it disappears
▪ When all cheese is gone, the mouse has won
▪ When the cat touches the mouse, the mouse has lost
▪ Extra challenge: pause/unpause with “p”
