File names

    index.php is obviously where the main content is and has links to imagefeed, upload and userlist.
    It's comprised of a header and a footer. The header has the login and logout form.

    .inc files is just a temporary script the user gets relocated to that could e.g. handle a form that got submitted.


The database migration file to use is madja16_sql.sql
No need to use the setup files. They are there to just show the simple database setup


dbh.inc.php has database username and password


Test user logins

    1. username = bob   password = bob

    2. username = john  password = john

    3. username = beki   password = beki
